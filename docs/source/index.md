This library provides a set of tools to fit lines in astronomical spectra. Its design aims for a user-friendly workflow 
for both single lines and large data sets. The library provides tools for masking, detecting, profile fitting and storing
the results. The output measurements are focused on the gas chemical and kinematic analysis. Check the scientific 
publication at [the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15072) and the video introduction:

Some of the library features are:

- Integrated and profile-dependent emission and absorption line flux measurements.
- The user can include the pixel error spectrum in the calculation.
- The Multi-Component profile parameters can be constrained by the user during the fitting.
- Tools to confirm the presence of lines.
- Interactive plots for the visual appraisal of inputs and outputs.
- Line labels adhere to the [PyNeb](http://research.iac.es/proyecto/PyNeb/) format.
- The measurements can be saved in several file types, including `.txt`, `.pdf`, multi-page `.fits`, `.asdf` and `.xlsx` files.

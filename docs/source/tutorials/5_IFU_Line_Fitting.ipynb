    "The workflow for an IFU observation is very similar to the one we saw in the previous tutorials for long-slit spectra. However, in order to preserve the spatial information and to maximise the quality of the measurements, it is recommended to use spatial masks. These provide two advantages:\n",
    "* In most cases, the scientific data does not cover full IFU field of view. To maximise your time and the computational resources, the non-scientific/noisy regions should be excluded from the analysis.\n",
    "* In resolved observations, the phenomena responsible for the observed radiation do not remain constant. This means that the properties of the emission lines can vary dramatically in a few spaxels. Consequently, your fittings should adapt to this spatial behaviour. Binary masks provide the means to personalise $LiMe$ fittings."

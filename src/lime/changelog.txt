LiMe release - 1.0.0 - 04/29/2024
   - First stable release

LiMe minor update - 1.0.1 - 05/04/2024
   - Created lime.io.parce_lime_cfg function to convert the .toml sections with lime suffix to the expected format to be its own operation
   - Created lime.plots.spectrum_labels to generate spectrum figure axis labels
   - Delete "log" attribute from lime.Cube class
   - Fix error normalize_fluxes was not cropping the lines frame for an input line list. Need to fix normalize flux error
   - log now returns the dataframe

LiMe minor update - 1.0.2 - 05/09/2024
   - SDSS lime.Spectrum.from_file no reads redshift from fits header

LiMe minor update - 1.0.3 - 05/09/2024
   - Restored deleted config.toml

LiMe minor update - 1.0.4 - 05/17/2024
   - Corrected MANGA flux error measurement
   - New tests for comparison between standard and lime loading of SDSS and MANGA observations
   - Change cm.get_cmap to plt.get_cmap due to matplotlib depreciation
   - Bug fix for multi-index flux extraction function due to pandas depreciation

LiMe minor update - 1.0.5 - 05/25/2024
   - Change "continuum_fit" keyword for toml keyword in continuum fitting configuration to "continuum" to match function name

LiMe minor update - 1.0.6 - 06/20/2024
   - Fix error in unit conversion of Cubes
   - Clearer messages for bands not matching the spectrum wavelength range
   - Added test for line fitting with line detection using implicit and explicit configuration and bands declaration
   - Plots using the automatic scale now show the scale as in figure text.
   - Added own stringBool from distiutils because it is being discontinued in python 3.12

LiMe minor update - 1.0.7 - 07/19/2024
   - define_masks function has been replaces by line.index_bands()
   - The line.index_bands() now warns if line does not have bands at the point of indexing an input spectrum wavelength.
   - Corrections on the measurements documentation page

LiMe minor update - 1.0.8 - 09/15/2024
   - The check_fit_cfg function now reviews if the continuum and line_detection functions parameters are present and gives a warning if not.
   - show_masks attribute in Spectrum.plot.spectrum to hide the pixels masks on the output plot.

LiMe medium update - 1.1.0 - 09/30/2024
   - By default LiMe will now mask the input spectrum if "nan" and "inf" entries are present in the flux and err_flux arrays but the user does not provide a pixel mask. If the user provides a mask but "nan" or "inf" entries are detected only a warning will be provided.
   - The website now includes the changelog with the LiMe updates.
   - Fixed bug where nan entries would cause an error in the line band detection.
   - New logic operator to store bands which only cover one pixel in band detection.
   - Documentation corrections by E.C. Herenz

LiMe minor update - 1.1.1 - 10/29/2024
    - Adding bands from frame function
    - Bug fix for re-normalization in the units_conversion function
    - Bug fix to normalize by 1 if nanmedian flux is <= 0
    - Added security fix for re-normalization in the units_conversion function
    - The review_bands function now checks if all the line_band pixels flux and all the continuum_band pixels flux sum is zero. This is done to avoid all zero line or continuum entries.

LiMe medium update - 1.2.0 - 11/05/2024
    - The unit_conversion functions have been updated to avoid bugs on betwen certain units
    - The unit_conversion functions now review the normalization and masking the same way as in the spectrum creation
    - The line detection function has been updated to account for masked data within the input line bands
    - The automatic normalization function now using the mean instead of median as the scale_flux
    - If the scale flux is negative the normalization will remove the lowest pixel value from the mean flux for the automatic normalization.
    - Initial introduction for aspect functions for thea automatic detection of spectral features.
    - New checks to avoid the measurements of bands where all the entries are masked.

LiMe minor update - 1.2.1 - 10/29/2024
    - Rename the "line_bands" argument in the lime.Spectrum.plot.spectrum function to "bands" to match library style
    - The lime.Spectrum.plot.spectrum function will now only display "bands" w3 and w4 values are within the rest wavelength range (no need to crop the bands in advance now).
    - Added support for reading MIRI IFU observations with MJy/str and um units
    - Corrected bug on the latex label generation in the lime.line_bands command not reproducing the expected format
    - The unit_conversion function for Cube observations now uses the format from the previous update.

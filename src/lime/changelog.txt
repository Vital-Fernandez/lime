1.0.0 LiMe Release
1.0.1 LiMe minor
   - Created lime.io.parce_lime_cfg function to convert the .toml sections with lime suffix to the expected format to
     be its own operation
   - Created lime.plots.spectrum_labels to generate spectrum figure axis labels
   - Delete "log" attribute from lime.Cube class
   - Fix error normalize_fluxes was not cropping the lines frame for an input line list. Need to fix normalize flux error
   - log now returns the dataframe
1.0.2 LiMe Minor
   - SDSS lime.Spectrum.from_file no reads redshift from fits header
1.0.3 LiMe Minor
   - Restored deleted config.toml
1.0.4 LiMe Minor
   - Corrected MANGA flux error measurement
   - New tests for comparison between standard and lime loading of SDSS and MANGA observations
   - Change cm.get_cmap to plt.get_cmap due to matplotlib depreciation
   - Bug fix for multi-index flux extraction function due to pandas depreciation
1.0.5 LiMe Minor
   - Change "continuum_fit" keyword for toml keyword in continuum fitting configuration to "continuum" to match function
     name
1.0.6 LiMe Minor
   - Fix error in unit conversion of Cubes
   - Clearer messages for bands not matching the spectrum wavelength range
   - Added test for line fitting with line detection using implicit and explicit configuration and bands declaration
   - Plots using the automatic scale now show the scale as in figure text.
   - AAdded own stringBool from distiutils because it is being discontinued in python 3.12
1.0.7 LiMe Minor
   - define_masks function has been replaces by line.index_bands()
   - The line.index_bands() now warns if line does not have bands at the point of indexing an input spectrum wavelength.
   - Corrections on the measurements documentation page
1.0.8
   - The check_fit_cfg function now reviews if the continuum and line_detection functions parameters are present and gives
   warning if not.
   - show_masks attribute in Spectrum.plot.spectrum to hide the pixels masks on the output plot

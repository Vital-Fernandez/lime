   - Change cm.get_cmap to plt.get_cmap due to matplotlib depreciation
   - Bug fix for multi-index flux extraction function due to pandas depreciation

LiMe minor update - 1.0.5 - 05/25/2024
   - Change "continuum_fit" keyword for toml keyword in continuum fitting configuration to "continuum" to match function name

LiMe minor update - 1.0.6 - 06/20/2024
   - Fix error in unit conversion of Cubes
   - Clearer messages for bands not matching the spectrum wavelength range
   - Added test for line fitting with line detection using implicit and explicit configuration and bands declaration
   - Plots using the automatic scale now show the scale as in figure text.
   - Added own stringBool from distiutils because it is being discontinued in python 3.12

LiMe minor update - 1.0.7 - 07/19/2024
   - define_masks function has been replaces by line.index_bands()
   - The line.index_bands() now warns if line does not have bands at the point of indexing an input spectrum wavelength.
   - Corrections on the measurements documentation page

LiMe minor update - 1.0.8 - 09/15/2024
   - The check_fit_cfg function now reviews if the continuum and line_detection functions parameters are present and gives a warning if not.
   - show_masks attribute in Spectrum.plot.spectrum to hide the pixels masks on the output plot.

LiMe medium update - 1.1.0 - 09/30/2024
   - By default LiMe will now mask the input spectrum if "nan" and "inf" entries are present in the flux and err_flux arrays but the user does not provide a pixel mask. If the user provides a mask but "nan" or "inf" entries are detected only a warning will be provided.
   - The website now includes the changelog with the LiMe updates.
   - Fixed bug where nan entries would cause an error in the line band detection.
   - New logic operator to store bands which only cover one pixel in band detection.
   - Documentation corrections by E.C. Herenz

LiMe minor update - 1.1.1 - 10/29/2024
    - Adding bands from frame function
    - Bug fix for re-normalization in the units_conversion function
    - Bug fix to normalize by 1 if nanmedian flux is <= 0
    - Added security fix for re-normalization in the units_conversion function
    - The review_bands function now checks if all the line_band pixels flux and all the continuum_band pixels flux sum is zero. This is done to avoid all zero line or continuum entries.

LiMe medium update - 1.2.0 - 11/05/2024
    - The unit_conversion functions have been updated to avoid bugs on betwen certain units
    - The unit_conversion functions now review the normalization and masking the same way as in the spectrum creation
    - The line detection function has been updated to account for masked data within the input line bands
    - The automatic normalization function now using the mean instead of median as the scale_flux
    - If the scale flux is negative the normalization will remove the lowest pixel value from the mean flux for the automatic normalization.
    - Initial introduction for aspect functions for thea automatic detection of spectral features.
    - New checks to avoid the measurements of bands where all the entries are masked.

LiMe minor update - 1.2.1 - 10/29/2024
    - Rename the "line_bands" argument in the lime.Spectrum.plot.spectrum function to "bands" to match library style
    - The lime.Spectrum.plot.spectrum function will now only display "bands" w3 and w4 values are within the rest wavelength range (no need to crop the bands in advance now).
    - Added support for reading MIRI IFU observations with MJy/str and um units
    - Corrected bug on the latex label generation in the lime.line_bands command not reproducing the expected format
    - The unit_conversion function for Cube observations now uses the format from the previous update.

LiMe medium update - 1.3.0 - 10/29/2024
    - This update includes ASPECT as an optional dependency and has adapted several functions to include the possibility to use its predictions
    - Added the Spectrum.retrieve attribute to group tasks which return data for the user related to the spectrum
    - Added the Spectrum.retrieve.line_bands to return the line bands which match the observation redshift, wave interval and components detection.
    - The lime.line_bands and Spectrum.retrieve.line_bands now use the argument "redshift" to adjust the output bands which are within a "wave_intvl" for that redshift (for the Spectrum.retrieve.line_bands this is always the case)
    - The lime.line_bands has been moved to the workflow.py file
    - The ".line_bands" have now use the new unit conversion function and includes more functionality via new update_labels=True, update_latex=True.
    - The inst_FWHM at the creation of observations has been replaced by res_power (resolving power) and now can be a float or an array (same length as the observation wavelength). This provides a more robust computation of the sigma_instr
    - The sigma_instr and sigma_thermal corrections are not computed within the sigma_corrections function
    - During the lime.Sample.get_spectrum the user can now specify kwargs arguments to update the creation kwargs for that object.
    - Several bugs were corrected on the lime.redshift_calculation to avoid very large errors when weak lines were present.
    - Bug correction on the previous update lime.Spectrum.plot.spectrum to plot bands within the observation wavelength range.
    - The lime.Sample.check.redshift function now has a new "initial_z" argument for the initial guess of the redshift measurement.
    - The lime.Sample.check.redshift "title_label" argument has been renamed -> "title" for consistency
    - The air_to_vacuum_function now only applies the theoretical relation, its inputs and outputs are wavelength arrays.
    - The new lime.Line.update_label function can be used to update the line label by reviewing the line properties.

LiMe Mayor update - 2.0.0 - XX/XX/XXXX
    - Change installer convention from "setup.py + requirements.txt" to pyproject.toml
    - Updated dependencies to current version of packages and for python 3.12
    - Renamed cfg.toml to lime.toml
    - Arrange library .py files into folder structure reproducing the .fit, .infer, .retrieve, .plot functions. The functions related to file types are are located in archives folder.
    - Added new mechanic to compute the lines continuum from the line band edges or the continua bands.
    - Added new mechanic to compute the pixel uncertainty from the provided uncertainty flux or the adjacent continua bands.
    - Fix error where the error from the line profile center and sigma parameters was uncertainty was 0 if the line kinematics were imported from a previously measured line.
    - Added support for bokeh plots.
    - The theme configuration parameters are stored now in the src/plotting/theme_lime.toml.
    - The .fit.report function now formats the output report to include the component label name and has the argument return_text=False to give the option to return the report message as a variable instead of printing on the terminal.
    - Fix a bug where the kinematics export function was not applying the correct rest frame wavelength length on the radial velocity calculation.
    - New ".infer" to host high level functions to predict spectroscopic features
    - The "Spectrum.line_detection()" has been moved to "Spectrum.infer.peaks_troughs()". The old function now raises and error moving to the new function.
    - Now the observations wave, flux, err_flux and wave_rest arrays are always masked arrays
    - The lines database name has been changed from parent_bands.txt to "lines_database_v2.0.0.txt". The wavelength are based on van Hoof, P.A.M., 2018, Galaxies, 6, 63 and Roueff+ (2019).
    - The central wavelenght bands are now calculated assuming a bands_vsigma=70 and n_sigma=4
    - The function lime.Spectrum.retrieve.spectrum() returns the spectrum axes as a recarray or saves it into a text file if the user provides a file address.
    - lime.Spectrum.from_file("fname", instrument='text') can now read the file from a text file following the format from the lime.Spectrum.retrieve.spectrum() function.
    - Bug the .plot.spectrum(include_fittings) does not show the combined profile
    - Rename term "_conf" to "_cfg" across function names and arguments for uniformity
    - Fitting functions now have the update_default=True argument. In the default behaviour the default configuration updates the default one. If set to update_default=False only the obj_cfg is used if available else the default one.
    - Creating a spectrum object where all the entries are masked now produces a critical warning instead of raising an error.
    - By default line_bands
